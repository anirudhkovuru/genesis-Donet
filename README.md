## Problem Statement
People don't have a personal connection when they're donating directly to an NGO. This may lead to lesser people donating, which will in turn lead to lesser funds for the relief program. In case a donor could know who was getting their money and how that person was spending it, a potential donor would be much more motivated to donate.
 
## Our Solution
Our solution is a direct peer-to-peer connection of the donor and the victim such that the donor knows who the receiver is and can therefore empathize more with them.

Our use cases are as follows

### Donor use case
1. The donor will be able to choose people to donate to based on several criteria, such as: age group, familial status (eg. married, single), disabilities, orphan status etc.

2. Based on the selected criteria, our recommendation system will suggest several potential receivers to donate to.

3. Once selected, the donor will then be provided with a virtual address to send money to (eg. Ethereum wallet). Money sent to this address will only be accessible by the selected receiver. The donor can share this address with their friends and family. This personal connection will enable the receiver to receive more funding.

### NGO use case
1. The NGO will only provide the necessary hardware for the receiver to access their address/wallet.

2. The necessary hardware includes biometric authentication and internet access.

### Receiver use case
1. The receiver can access the donated money through the hardware provided by the NGO. Nobody else will be able to access their money, not even the NGO.

2. The money will automatically be deducted from their address after scanning their fingerprint at a food stall, grocery store etc.
